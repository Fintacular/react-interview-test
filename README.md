# react-interview-test
This is the interview test designed to evaluate the skills of front end engineers applying for a job at Krewter. There is no one correct answer, and we will be looking at a lot of different things when evaluating your answer. This test is also mirrors our architecture and development environment so it is designed to give you, the applicant, a small taste of how we develop. 

## Intro
This codebase contains the start to a timer application. The user can enter timers, which start counting down as soon as they're submitted. Timers can be cancelled, snoozed or dismissed. That's all we will tell you, the rest you will just have to figure out from the code.

## How to take the test and apply
1. Fork this repo
2. Build your solution and commit it to your fork
3. Open a pull request with your information in the comments

## Next steps
After you submit your solution we'll get back to you as soon as possible. If you feel like the test was pretty easy, and you were comfortable with the environment, we'll set up a face to face to get to know you better. If not, we will provide you with feedback and hopefully introduce you to some new ways of doing things. 

A note on cheating: this test is not designed to weed out cheaters. You can get a friend or collegue to solve it for you. You can even google for a solution, but if this test isn't fairly easy for you to complete, we will know in the face to face, and you will have wasted everyones time. If you do find that you can't do it, but feel like you can learn, great! Go learn and take it again in a few weeks/months. :)
